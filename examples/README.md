The unified Rust crate we developed consolidates several core functionalities crucial for building a secure and privacy-preserving federated learning (FL) application. This crate includes:

1.	Model Training, Fetching, and Updating:

Provides a standardized interface for starting local model training and retrieving the updated model weights from clients, facilitating seamless integration across different FL clients.

On the server side, includes functions for receiving model weights from clients and updating the global model, ensuring continuous and effective learning based on the latest contributions from clients.

2.	Secret Sharing:

Implements secret sharing protocols to enable secure, decentralized data aggregation, ensuring that individual client data remains confidential even during collaborative learning.

3.	Differential Privacy (DP) Mechanisms:

Integrates DP techniques to add noise to the model updates, providing strong privacy guarantees and preventing inference attacks on the shared weights.

4.	Encryption Layers:

Offers robust encryption methods for securing model parameters during transmission, safeguarding against man-in-the-middle attacks.

5.	Encrypted Federated Averaging (FedAvg):

Supports an encrypted FedAvg protocol on the server side, allowing aggregation of model weights without decrypting them. This ensures that the server cannot access individual client updates directly, enhancing the overall security of the federated learning process.
Application Development: With this unified crate, we can now build a federated learning application where clients use this crate to perform local training, apply differential privacy, and encrypt model updates before transmission. On the server side, the application leverages encrypted FedAvg functionality to aggregate these updates securely while also utilizing functions to fetch and update the global model dynamically. This modular and secure approach facilitates building scalable federated learning systems with enhanced privacy and security guarantees.
